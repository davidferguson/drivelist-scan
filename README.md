# drivelist-scan
Detect when a drive has been inserted/removed. Replacement for drivelist-scanner.

Written for and used in [PiBakery](http://github.com/davidferguson/PiBakery)

Versions of PiBakery below and including 0.3.6 use drivelist-scanner. However, drivelist-scanner seems to be currently unmaintained and has bugs and therefore this module replaces the most basic functionality of detecting when a drive has been added and removed.
